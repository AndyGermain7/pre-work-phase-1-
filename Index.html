<h1>Pre-work Phase 1</h1>
<p>Git is version control software that we run our computer.</p>
<p>GitHub is a version web application that works with Git to help collaborate and share with others.</p>
<p>ddc_web-student.cnm.edu is the bootcamp server that runs our code.</p>
<p>We add and commit our code to Git on our computer.</p>
<p>We PUSH our code from our computer to GitHub.</p>
<p>We DEPLOY our code from our computer to the bootcamp server.</p>
<p>DEPLOY and PUSH are different!</p>
